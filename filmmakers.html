              <h1>GAYE MILLER: CO-PRODUCER, RESEARCHER</h1>
              <p>Gaye has a strong spiritual connection with Cambodia and spends as much time as possible there. Whilst in Cambodia, she works closely with several orphanages as a sponsor and English teacher. She pays university fees and is a mentor and 'Mother' to a group of desperately poor students. Her greatest challenge has been getting shipping containers into Cambodia. Through sheer perseverance and a never say die attitude, she succeeded where big corporations had previously failed. She then faced the logistical night mare of organising a fleet of trucks and drivers to deliver the contents to far flung rural areas. Gaye has single handedly set up a library, a medical clinic, taught English, supplied bicycles so students can attend school, delivered thousands of mosquito nets in malaria prone areas, paid university fees and living allowances, supplied surgical equipment and much more. In 2008 Gaye was nominated for Australian of the Year for her humanitarian work in Cambodia.</p>
