          <p>Hom Chhorn has a young family and a comfortable life in suburban Melbourne, yet remains wracked by childhood memories of one of the worst atrocities in human history. At age 6, he was imprisoned at a remote site 4,000 miles away in rural Cambodia, where more than 30,000 people -- including his father and brothers -- were killed at the hands of a pro-communist regime known as the Khmer Rouge.</p>
          <p>There are no records of the labour camp in which Hom bore witness to a daily succession of cruelty, starvation, disease and cold-blooded executions. After 33 years, Hom returns to his former homeland to find proof of the source of his nightmares, to find Camp 32.</p>
          <p>His mission is a painful one that uproots memories and emotions attached to a past his closest surviving relatives have fought hard to put behind them. For Hom, the search for Camp 32 offers hope of making peace with an incredulous part of his life and a place indelibly marked in Cambodia's history as The Killing Fields.</p>
          <p>Hom's odyssey begins in Phnom Penh, where he crisscrosses the city in a frustrating hunt for clues. None of the institutions, libraries, government offices or United Nations agencies he visits have any information on Camp 32, let alone documents that can confirm its existence. Miraculously, a path opens with the discovery of Sovin, a Camp 32 survivor, whom he visits in her village on the border with Vietnam, a 3-hour drive away.</p>
          <p>Sovin's memories of the horrors inflicted in the shade of a leaning tamarind tree square exactly with Hom's -- eerie proof that what he remembers really did happen. Sovin's account is certainly no less harrowing. Starved and beaten almost to the point of death, she was forced to strip naked in a line before a shallow grave she and other prisoners were made to dig the previous day. One by one, those in the line were pushed into the ditch after having their throats cut by their Khmer Rouge guards. Those still writhing were shot dead. Sovin was lucky. Her throat wasn't cut deeply enough to kill her. Lying motionless among bloodied corpses, Sovin was left for dead. Hours after the guards had gone, she crawled out of the ditch and eventually made it to a village, where her bloodied throat was treated.</p>
          <p>The memories are still too raw for Sovin, who turns down Hom's invitation to join him on his search for Camp 32. Instead, she directs him to Sophal, another escapee living in Phnom Penh. Like Sovin, Sophal is reluctant to endure the trauma that would come from finding Camp 32. Her recollections help Hom sketch a basic map that will make the site easier to pinpoint later on.</p>
          <p>Hom's surviving siblings, too, refuse to accompany him. Elder sister Vanna recounts how she laboured with little food and was forced by the Khmer Rouge to marry a brutal man. Elder brother Ricky says he witnessed horrific punishments by his captors. Another brother, Sam, recalls having to remove the clothes of murdered prisoners -- images that he still struggles with. Sister Sokhamony frets that Hom's return to Cambodia will only bring more anguish.</p>
          <p>Painful memories are easily evoked when Hom visits a monument to The Killing Fields in Phnom Penh and sees skulls piled high alongside clothes worn by prisoners. Hom presses on, visiting his birthplace, Battambang, where he meets Sak, a local guide, who helps piece together Hom's earliest childhood memories.</p>
          <p>Still, Hom is no closer to finding Camp 32. Not knowing where to turn, Hom flags a taxi to take him to the final resting place of his father and brother, hoping desperately that their fatal connection to the camp will open up a fresh lead. What happens next will change Hom's life forever.</p>
